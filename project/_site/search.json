    "text": "Let’s perform an analysis on tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. The data that we’ll be using is from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship. The CSV file can be found here while the data documentation can be found here.\nTropical cyclones are also known as tropical systems. They generally form near the tropical regions where the ocean is at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This warm water evaporates which creates warm moist air that acts as fuel for the storms. When this warm air rises into the atmosphere it begins to cool and large stormy clouds begin to form. As more warm air continues to rise then the winds will spiral and increase in speed.\nThe wind speed in the tropical cyclones is used to classify each storm. According to the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale we have the following table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTropical Cyclone\nSustained Wind Speed\nType of Hurricane\nNamed\n\n\n\n\nTropical Depression\n38 mph or less\nNot a hurricane\nUnnamed\n\n\nTropical Storm\n39 - 73 mph\nNot a hurricane\nNamed\n\n\nCategory 1\n74 - 95 mph\nHurricane\nNamed\n\n\nCategory 2\n96 - 110 mph\nHurricane\nNamed\n\n\nCategory 3\n111 - 129 mph\nMajor hurricane\nNamed\n\n\nCategory 4\n130 - 156 mph\nMajor hurricane\nNamed\n\n\nCategory 5\n157 mph or higher\nMajor hurricane\nNamed\n\n\n\nIt’s also important to note that hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are all tropical cyclones but are referred to as different names depending on the location in which they form. Hurricanes form in the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, and eastern North Pacific. Cyclones form in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Finally, typhoons form in the Northwest Pacific. More information on hurricanes form can be found at the University Corporation For Atmospheric Research."

Therefore we have\n\n# 74 mph = 64.30 knots\n\nnamed_hurricanes = DF %&gt;%\n  group_by(NAME) %&gt;%\n  select(NAME, SEASON, WMO_WIND) %&gt;%\n  filter(WMO_WIND &gt; 64.30) %&gt;%\n  count(SEASON)\n\nLet’s display the first 5 rows of named_hurricanes\n\nhead(named_hurricanes)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   NAME [3]\n  NAME    SEASON     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 AGNES     1972     6\n2 ALBERTO   1982     2\n3 ALBERTO   2000    47\n4 ALEX      2004    13\n5 ALEX      2010     8\n6 ALEX      2016     9\n\n\nNow using named_hurricanes we can create a new data frame num_named_hurricanes which contains all of the named hurricanes that happened per year\n\nnum_named_hurricanes = named_hurricanes %&gt;%\n  group_by(SEASON) %&gt;%\n  count(SEASON)\n\nLet’s display the first 5 rows of num_named_hurricanes\n\nhead(num_named_hurricanes)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n# Groups:   SEASON [6]\n  SEASON     n\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1   1970     4\n2   1971     6\n3   1972     3\n4   1973     4\n5   1974     4\n6   1975     6\n\n\nNow we can compute the average number of named hurricanes\n\nmean(num_named_hurricanes$n)\n\n[1] 6.480769\n\n\nWe can extract the total number of named hurricanes in 2012 with the following code\n\nfilter(num_named_hurricanes, SEASON == 2012)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n# Groups:   SEASON [1]\n  SEASON     n\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1   2012    10\n\n\nTherefore the average number of named hurricanes between 1970 and 2021 was about 6 per year. In 2012 there was 10 named hurricanes. Therefore 2012 was an above-average year.\nWe can see this in the following graph\n\nggplot(data = num_named_hurricanes, aes(x = SEASON, y = n)) +\n  geom_col(width = .8,\n           fill = my_grey1) + \n  labs(title = \"Total Number of Named Hurricanes\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing the historical average number of named hurricanes to the 2012 season\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total\") + \n  geom_col(data = filter(num_named_hurricanes, SEASON == 2012),\n           color = my_red,\n           fill = my_red,\n           width = .8) + \n  geom_text(x = 2013.5,\n            y = 10.8, \n            label = \"2012\",\n            color = my_red,\n            size = 6.8) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(num_named_hurricanes$n),\n             col = my_blue,\n             size = 1) + \n  geom_text(x = 1974,\n            y = 10.3,\n            size = 6,\n            col = my_blue,\n            show.legend = TRUE,\n            aes(label = \"Average\")) +\n  geom_segment(x = 1974, y = 9.5,\n               xend = 1974, yend = 6.8,\n               lineend = \"round\",\n               linejoin = \"round\",\n               size = .7,\n               color = my_blue,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, \"cm\"),\n                             type = \"closed\"),\n               )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.c.) Compared to the “historical” average of maximum winds, was the 2012 season an above-average, a below-average, or an average season?\nFirst, let’s create a data frame max_winds which contains the maximum winds per year. Therefore we have\n\n# For the 2021 season the wind speeds are not available\n\nmax_winds = DF %&gt;%\n  filter(SEASON != 2022) %&gt;% \n  select(SEASON, WMO_WIND) %&gt;%\n  group_by(SEASON) %&gt;%\n  summarise(max_wmo_wind = max(WMO_WIND, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nLet’s display the first 5 rows of max_winds\n\nhead(max_winds)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  SEASON max_wmo_wind\n   &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1   1970          120\n2   1971          140\n3   1972           90\n4   1973          100\n5   1974          130\n6   1975          120\n\n\nNow we can compute the average of max winds between 1970 and 2020\n\nmean(max_winds$max_wmo_wind)\n\n[1] 126.3462\n\n\nWe can extract the maximum wind speeds in 2012 with the following code\n\nfilter(max_winds, SEASON == 2012)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  SEASON max_wmo_wind\n   &lt;int&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1   2012          100\n\n\nTherefore the average of maximum winds between 1970 and 2020 was about 126 knots or about 145 mph. The maximum wind speed in 2012 was about 100 knots or about 115 mph. Therefore 2012 was a below-average season with respect to maximum wind speeds.\nWe can show this with the following graph\n\nggplot(data = max_winds, aes(x = SEASON, y = max_wmo_wind)) + \n  labs(title = \"Maximum Wind Speeds\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparing the historical average of maximum wind speeds to the 2012 season\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Maximum Wind in Knots\") +\n  geom_line(linetype = \"dashed\",\n            color = my_grey1) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.8,\n             color = my_grey2) + \n  geom_point(x = 2012,\n             y = 100,\n             size = 3,\n             color = my_red) + \n  geom_text(x = 2008.5,\n            y = 96,\n            color = my_red,\n            size = 6.8,\n            label = \"2012\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(max_winds$max_wmo_wind),\n             size = 1,\n             color = my_blue\n             ) + \n  geom_text(x = 1979,\n            y = 95,\n            size = 6,\n            color = my_blue,\n            label = \"Average\") + \n  geom_segment(x = 1979.8, y = 100,\n               xend = 1979.8, yend = 123,\n               lineend = \"round\",\n               linejoin = \"round\",\n               size = .7,\n               color = my_blue,\n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(.3, \"cm\"),\n                             type = \"closed\"))"
